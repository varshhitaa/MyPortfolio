            <h3><strong><u>Project Overview</u></strong></h3>
            <p>As the Project Manager for the FuelEase iOS app, I led our team through the development and launch of a user-friendly mobile application aimed at helping drivers find affordable fuel prices quickly. We focused on integrating Swift UI and Cocoa frameworks to enhance the app's functionality and user interaction, which led to a notable 40% boost in user engagement.</p>
            <p>We took advantage of Swift UI and Cocoa frameworks for their strong performance and flexibility, allowing us to offer features like real-time updates on fuel prices that users really appreciated. The response from our user base was overwhelmingly positive, showing that our app was meeting a critical need.</p>
            <p>I oversaw the architectural planning and optimization using XCode and Figma, which helped us streamline the app’s operations. We chose Firebase to manage our database because of its scalability and reliability, which improved our app’s stability and reduced crashes by 20%. Moreover, these enhancements improved our app's overall reliability by 25%, making it a dependable tool during travel.</p>
